This template illustrate the use of the GitHub MATIN collaboration system.

MATIN is a system that enables seamless collaboration between materials scientists, manufacturers, and data scientist.  MATIN will
* Strategically suggest and promote new collaborations
* Default and *fully customizable* web templates for your research metadata, visualizations, and codes.
* Provide a project management system for large-scale materials science research
* Improve the pedigree of data
* Federated metadata
* Bug and Issue Tracking

## Master Branch
The master branch is a Version Control System for simulation, conversion, and analysis tools for Polymer Molecular Dynamics Simulations generated by Karl Jacobs group at the Georgia Institue of Technology.

#### Data 
MATIN operates under the assumption that data does not need to be versioned, but metadata does.  Metadata will be modified in a collaborative manner using public facing web-pages.  Large data packets will remain local and metadata will be federated.

## gh-pages Branch
Contains is a public facing content management system for metadata, visualization, and master branch tools that enable promote discovery in material science.

gh-pages is a special branch that works with [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) to create public facing web content using GitHub as a web server.  [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) are powered by [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com) which allow webpages to be deployed concurrently with the git repo.

#### Metadata 
Metadata is stored in a markup language to generate web pages from fully customizable web pages.
